# 📊 Data Analysis with API

A hands-on learning project focused on exploring data analysis techniques using public APIs. This project demonstrates how to fetch, process, and visualize real-world data programmatically, using Python and various libraries.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice making API requests and handling responses
- Clean and structure incoming JSON or CSV data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Generate meaningful visualizations
- Improve understanding of real-world data workflows

---

## 🛠️ What’s Included

- 📡 API Request Scripts — for fetching data from various APIs  
- 🧹 Data Processing Modules — for cleaning and transforming data  
- 📈 Visualization Code — built with libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly`  
- 🧪 Experimental Notebook(s) — for testing and iterating on ideas  
- 🗃️ Modular Codebase — easy to extend and adapt for new data sources

## 🔄 Workflow Overview

1. **Fetch Data**  
   Use `requests` or a custom wrapper to pull data from an API.

2. **Parse & Clean**  
   Transform raw data into structured DataFrames.

3. **Analyze**  
   Perform descriptive statistics or EDA.

4. **Visualize**  
   Use charts to uncover trends and insights.

## 🧠 Learning Focus

This project is designed as a **learning sandbox** — ideal for anyone looking to:
- Understand how APIs integrate into data pipelines
- Build confidence with data wrangling in Python
- Experiment with visualization libraries
- Try out data storytelling with real-world data
