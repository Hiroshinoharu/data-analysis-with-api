# data-analysis-with-api

## Project Description

This project is created for learning purposes to explore data analysis techniques using APIs. The goal is to practice fetching, processing, and visualizing data from various API sources to gain hands-on experience with data analysis workflows.

### Notes

- The project includes scripts and modules for making API requests, handling data, and generating visualizations.
- It serves as a practical learning tool to understand how to work with APIs and analyze real-world data.
- The codebase is organized to facilitate experimentation and iterative learning.
- Users can extend the project by adding new data sources, analysis methods, or visualization techniques.
- This README will be updated as the project evolves to document new features and insights.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own data analysis projects.
